We made a lot of changes up to our wedding, and the team was great at adjusting with us. The food was divine, and we did a unique personal specialty cocktail that was hands down everyone’s favorite! â€¦ The bartenders were great with conversation, the servers were excellent and so helpful with my 91 year old Grandma, and the experience was top notch.\n",

      "We hired the Made By Meg (MBM) team for our small, intimate wedding this past May and they were absolutely amazing… They have the entire process down; everything is so organized and all the little details are considered and communicatedâ€¦ She helped us finalize all the details of our contract (as we made a few customizations) and ran through the timeline and finishing touches with us before the wedding… Everything was set beautifully, the food was delicious, and everyone was just so kind and a joy to work with. Would highly recommend this team, if you are thinking about hiring a catering company for your next event! :))\n",

Food safety is extremely important to us, and we do our due diligence to ensure we have the temperature control to maintain the food's highest quality during transit. Our service is customizable, and we cater and prepare the food specifically for your desired service style. For drop-off deliveries, the food can be sent fully cooked and ready for consumption the minute the driver leaves at your doorstep. For full-service catering, your food is sent to your event along with our culinary team cut, diced, and/or par-cooked as-needed so that the food will be cooked in the most efficient manor and served fresh for your event.\n",
      "What kind of different styles of services do you offer?\n",
      "We offer all types of catering service styles, including full-service offerings such as plated dinners, buffets, live-action stations, hors d'oeuvres, grazing stations, and bar services.

The number of Chefs, Cooks, Servers, Staff Captains, and Bartenders for each event is determined by Made by Meg Catering according to the guest count and menu selections. This includes one Staff Captain per event, approximately one Chef per 20-25 guests, and one Server per 10-15 guests. A full staff will attend all events, with the exception of our drop-off service. For catering pricing for your upcoming event, please fill out our Request a Quote intake form here: https://mbmcatering.com/contact/\n",
      "How long will your full-service catering team be at my event?\n",
      "For full-service catering events, Made by Meg Catering staff will arrive approximately 1Â½ to 2 hours prior to guestsâ€™ arrival for event setup and food preparation. Within the 2-hour set up time, they will place linens, fold napkins, set glassware and set the table for each of your guests.

      "We had a fantastic time with Leslie from Made by Meg, as well as all our day of staff and coordinators that handled our wedding… Our tasting was special, and we loved the personal touches. We made a lot of changes up to our wedding, and the team was great at adjusting with us. The food was divine, and we did a unique personal specialty cocktail that was hands down everyone’s favorite! â€¦ The bartenders were great with conversation, the servers were excellent and so helpful with my 91 year old Grandma, and the experience was top notch.\n",
      "~ Kelly R.\n",
      "We hired the Made By Meg (MBM) team for our small, intimate wedding this past May and they were absolutely amazing… They have the entire process down; everything is so organized and all the little details are considered and communicatedâ€¦ She helped us finalize all the details of our contract (as we made a few customizations) and ran through the timeline and finishing touches with us before the wedding… Everything was set beautifully, the food was delicious, and everyone was just so kind and a joy to work with. Would highly recommend this team, if you are thinking about hiring a catering company for your next event! :))\n",

      "While we have a variety of other dessert options available with Made by Meg Catering, we do not provide a wedding cake or storage for early deliveries. We have a great list of local wedding cake bakers we are happy to recommend alongside your catering service. Made by Meg will provide the cutting, serving, and bussing of cake to your guests.\n",
      "Do you offer party rentals? Equipment?\n",
      "Yes, we do have a selection of equipment items available in-house that can be rented and used for your event. If we do not have items that match your vision for your event, we can procure them for an additional cost, and we highly recommend Bright Rentals, as they have large variety of rental equipment available for you to choose from.\n",
      "How are the food prepped and delivered to events?\n",
      "Once the food is prepared at our main headquarters in Torrance, California, it's then packaged and stored appropriately. This may involve using food-safe containers, refrigeration for perishable items, and proper labeling to ensure easy identification. On the day of the event, the food is transported from our main kitchen/catering facility to your designated the event venue. Food safety is extremely important to us, and we do our due diligence to ensure we have the temperature control to maintain the food's highest quality during transit. Our service is customizable, and we cater and prepare the food specifically for your desired service style. For drop-off deliveries, the food can be sent fully cooked and ready for consumption the minute the driver leaves at your doorstep. For full-service catering, your food is sent to your event along with our culinary team cut, diced, and/or par-cooked as-needed so that the food will be cooked in the most efficient manor and served fresh for your event.\n",
      "What kind of different styles of services do you offer?\n",
      "We offer all types of catering service styles, including full-service offerings such as plated dinners, buffets, live-action stations, hors d'oeuvres, grazing stations, and bar services. All full-service catering services include staff and an on-site staff captain to help manage the event. We also offer delivery only, pick up, and drop off and staff setup services.\n",
      "What does full-service mean?\n",
      "Full-Service Catering is our main comprehensive package which handles all aspects of food preparation, presentation, service, and cleanup for an event. This service is often selected for weddings, corporate events, and large gatherings where clients prefer a seamless experience without having to worry about the logistical and service details.\n",
      "What areas do you service?\n",
      "We primarily service Greater Los Angeles and Orange Counties for catering, including all of LA County, Orange County, Palm Springs, Malibu, Calabasas, and the Inland Empire.\n",
      "How do you price and staff your full-service catering team?\n",
      "Made by Meg staff hold a 4-hour minimum for full-service bookings. All Made by Meg staff are professionally trained and will make you and your guests feel special on this great occasion. We hire and train our own staff in person in-house and do not contract out to staffing services. Made by Meg staff training is mandatory for all service staff employees before working an event, and they are held to the highest service standards. The number of Chefs, Cooks, Servers, Staff Captains, and Bartenders for each event is determined by Made by Meg Catering according to the guest count and menu selections. This includes one Staff Captain per event, approximately one Chef per 20-25 guests, and one Server per 10-15 guests. A full staff will attend all events, with the exception of our drop-off service. For catering pricing for your upcoming event, please fill out our Request a Quote intake form here: https://mbmcatering.com/contact/\n",
      "How long will your full-service catering team be at my event?\n",
      "For full-service catering events, Made by Meg Catering staff will arrive approximately 1Â½ to 2 hours prior to guestsâ€™ arrival for event setup and food preparation. Within the 2-hour set up time, they will place linens, fold napkins, set glassware and set the table for each of your guests. Made by Meg staff cleans the venue according to the venue's specifications and departs the premises approximately one hour after the event.\n",
      "Do you offer bar catering? What beverages can you serve?\n",
      "One of the values of the Made by Meg culinary experience is our ability to create a custom bar package to best complement your food menu. We offer everything from craft beer and wine to top shelf, call, and well bar packages. We have a Type 83 full alcohol liquor license, and we are one of only ten companies in the state of California that has that type of license to service wherever youâ€™re hosting an event, whether thatâ€™s a state park or a private residence. We also have the LA Rec and Park Beverage Contract allowing us to service all LA County recreation and park indoor and outdoor venues, such as the Friendship Auditorium in Griffith Park, Grace E. Simons Lodge in Elysian Park, Cabrillo Beach Bath House, Brand Park Community Center in Mission Hills, and Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center in West Hills.\n",
